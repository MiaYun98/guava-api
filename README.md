# guava-api

## Description 

This is an API for the Shurb-club that we created for the back-end of the project. 

It is deployed with Heroku App and connected with the netlify deployed Shrub-club. 

We used it as a fetch data on Shrub-club and it contains all the user information, shurb information, profile, items, and other elements that associated with the user profile. 

We used mySQL as a database and it is connected with each other. 

Also, all the Items datas are implemented by hands. 

## UserStory 

```md
As a User Who wants to store data of the shrub and profile information in the database. 
I WANT to have a each section of the data and easily fetch the data to the front end
SO THAT while working with the React.js it won't cause a merge conflict and easy to work with the team mates without working space issues. 

```
